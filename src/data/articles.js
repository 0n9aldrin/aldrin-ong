							In the heart of{" "}
							<a href="http://berkeley.edu">Berkeley's</a> vibrant
							community, consulting clubs are a coveted oasis of
							experiential learning for many students, offering a
							vital bridge between the academic and professional
							world. However, with acceptance rates dipping under
							5%, these clubs have built a reputation akin to
							elite institutions — exclusive, competitive, and
							incredibly demanding. The prestige and competition
							can be intimidating, but remember that you’re up
							against fellow Berkeley students — students who,
							like you, have already triumphed over the
							university’s rigorous{" "}
							<a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/08/10/uc-berkeley-offers-nearly-20000-students-admission-for-2022-23/">
								11% acceptance rate
							</a>
							.
						</p>

						<p>
							Getting into a consulting club is an achievement,
							but it’s crucial not to let it become the sole
							barometer of your potential. Some clubs may be more
							prestigious than others, but the value of the
							experience you gain often transcends the club’s
							name. If you don’t get in, don’t beat yourself up.
							Use it as a stepping stone to learn, refine your
							skills, and come back stronger.

							Hello, I’m Aldrin, a student at Berkeley studying
							Computer Science and Data Science. Although my
							career path doesn’t intersect directly with
							consulting, my involvement in the consulting
							ecosystem for several semesters offers me a unique
							vantage point.
						</p>

						<p>
							In this two-part series, I aim to demystify
							Berkeley’s consulting club circuit, drawing upon my
							experiences and insights. This first installment
							delves into the nitty-gritty of breaking into these
							clubs — from crafting a compelling resume and
							application, to acing interviews and making the most
							of networking. The second part will offer an
							overview of the clubs themselves, helping you find
							the best fit for your aspirations and skills. Stay
							tuned for a comprehensive exploration of Berkeley’s
							consulting club culture.

						<h3>1. Crafting a Winning Resume</h3>

						<p>
							Before you even step into an interview room, your
							resume must effectively communicate your potential
							to the recruiting team. It’s your personal marketing
							document that needs to encapsulate your skills,
							experiences, achievements, and potential in a
							concise and appealing manner.
						</p>

						<p>
							Most freshmen might not have written a resume
							before, but consulting club recruitment offers an
							excellent opportunity to get your resume in shape
							for the professional world. Reach out to seniors,
							utilize campus career services, and if clubs offer
							resume workshops or templates, don’t hesitate to
							make the most of them.
						</p>

						<p>Use the XYZ format:</p>

						<blockquote>
							Google describes this as: “Accomplished [X] as
							measured by [Y], by doing [Z].” But just to make it
							easier to remember, let’s shorten it to X-Y-Z.
						</blockquote>

						<p>
							The popular{" "}
							<a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhwpi.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Focs%2Ffiles%2Fhes-resume-cover-letter-guide.pdf">
								Harvard format
							</a>{" "}
							offers an ideal structure with a clear layout and
							emphasis on achievements. It includes the following
							sections: Contact Information, Education, Work
							Experience, Activities & Leadership, Skills, and
							Interests. If this is your first resume, please take
							some time to go through this resource, it offers
							solid advice — action verbs, common mistakes, etc.
							Don’t use anything fancy, these{" "}
							<a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fresumeworded.com%2Fgoogle-docs-resume-templates">
								templates
							</a>{" "}
							will do.
						</p>

						<p>
							One really important piece of advice — always
							quantify your impact with numbers and metrics
							wherever possible, and avoid fluff or overly
							technical jargon.
						</p>

						<p>
							For example, instead of writing “Led a team
							project,” you could write “Directed a team of 5 to
							implement a fundraising campaign, raising $10,000
							for local charities.” This conveys your leadership
							skills, initiative, and the tangible impact you
							created. There should be at least 2 numbers/metrics
							per experience.
						</p>

						<p>
							Some clubs have rubrics that they use to “grade”
							resumes. Some popular rubric items: GPA, impact,
							awards, experiences. Keep in mind that students in
							recruiting teams may read hundreds of resumes, so
							make sure that your resume is legible.
						</p>

						<h3>2. Crafting an Outstanding Application/Essay</h3>

						<p>
							The application essay provides a canvas to showcase
							your personality, passion, and what sets you apart
							from the crowd. However, the key is to avoid generic
							statements and flattery. Your essay should stand out
							— not blend in.
						</p>

						<p>
							Start with an engaging hook — something that will
							grab the reader’s attention from the first sentence.
							Perhaps it’s a powerful quote, an interesting fact
							about yourself, or an intriguing question.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once you’ve hooked the reader, dive into your
							narrative. Talk about your unique experiences,
							perspectives, and values. Connect these to the world
							of consulting, demonstrating how your background has
							shaped your interest in the field.
						</p>

						<p>
							Your essay should also highlight your goals and
							ambitions. How do you see the club helping you
							achieve them? This shows your strategic thinking and
							ensures the club that you’re not only a passionate
							candidate, but you have a clear vision for your
							journey.
						</p>

						<p>
							Finally, wrap up with a compelling conclusion. Don’t
							just repeat your introduction or main points — go a
							step further. Make a final, impactful statement that
							leaves the reader with a strong impression of you as
							a candidate.
